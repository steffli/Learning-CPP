# Introduction to C++
After making experiences with C and working close to the system i decided to get started to learn C++ as part of my journey. Object-oriented-programming is a powerful concept and makes code more modular and reusable whilst keeping it maintainable.


## C vs C++
C and C++ are popular programming languages with some similarities, but also key differences. C++ is an extension of C with added features such as object-oriented programming, classes and exception handling.

* Syntax and Semantic:  

__C__: procedual programming language, no support for objects or classes, manual memory management  

__C++__: procedural and object-oriented programming language, supports objects and classes, memory management is manual or can rely on constructors, destructors and smart pointers  

* Code Reusability:

__C__: functions and modular programming, functions libs can be created and added throgh headers

__C++__: better reusability with classes, inheritance and polymorphism, modularity through well designed object-oriented hierarchy

* Error handling:

__C__: error handling through return codes, lacks support for exceptions or any built-in error handling mechanisms

__C++__: exception handling, catching and handling exceptions with try, catch and throw keywords, more control over error handling
